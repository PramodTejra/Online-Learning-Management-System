### 2. **Start XAMPP Services**
- Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
- Start the following services:
  - **Apache** (for running PHP).
  - **MySQL** (for managing the database).

---

### 3. **Place Project Files**
- Navigate to the XAMPP installation folder:
  - **Windows**: `C:\\xampp\\htdocs`
  - **Mac**: `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs`
  - **Linux**: `/opt/lampp/htdocs`
- Create a new folder (e.g., `my_project`) inside `htdocs`.
- Copy your project files into this folder.

---

### 4. **Set Up the Database**
- Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
- Create a new database:
  - Click on **Databases**.
  - Enter a database name and click **Create**.
- Import your database (if provided):
  - Go to the **Import** tab.
  - Choose the SQL file and click **Go**.

---

### 5. **Configure the Project**
- Edit the projectâ€™s database configuration file (commonly `config.php` or `.env`):
  - Set the database host to `localhost`.
  - Use `root` as the username.
  - Leave the password field empty (default for XAMPP).
  - Set the database name to the one you created.

Example (`config.php`):  
```php
$host = 'localhost';
$db = 'your_database_name';
$user = 'root';
$pass = '';
```

### 6. **Run the Project**
- Open your browser and go to:
  - [http://localhost/my_project](http://localhost/my_project)
